      // eslint-disable-next-line
      cardSubtitle: "The Mock Discovery Call was the first opportunity to try to play the role \
      of an actual Solutions Engineer. The purpose of this activity was to learn more about a customer's \
      technical pain points, their use case, technical requirements, and any additional information that \
      would alter the potential solution we find as a Solutions Engineer. The most difficult part of this \
      activity was trying to actively listen to all of the customer's information, while simulatenously \
      navigating the conversation in a direction that would uncover more relevant information.",

      cardSubtitle: "The Solutions Brief was the first milestone that put me in front of an audience. \
      This was the first test of my public speaking skills, a skill that I had not practiced in a couple of years. \
      This activity required that I take the information learned from the Mock Discovery Call, find a viable solution \
      that covers the technical requirements of the customer, and present it via powerpoint presentation. The most \
      difficult part of this project for me was the public speaking aspect. I had to maintain a rate of speech, enunciate \
      properly, while remembering all of the information of my presentation. This activity required multiple rehearsals \
      to ensure a good final presentation.",

      cardTitle: "WISE Demo using Owl Platform",
      // eslint-disable-next-line
      cardSubtitle: "The first Demo opportunity! Since I was still very new to the practice of giving a demo of a \
      solution, I was allowed to use a pre-existing demo from the Owl Platform. The demo that I chose was called 'Owl Air' \
      and it is used to demonstrate the ease of use and potential uses of Twilio Flex. The demo required that I demonstrate \
      what a customer of the company 'Owl Air' would experience if they were to have issues rebooking their flight. The user \
      would request to speak to an agent on the Owl Air website and speak to a chatbot before being redirected to an agent. \
      The agent would get a dashboard full of information regarding the current customer, as well as quick and easy options \
      to assist the customer. This was the first activity in which I learned to provide a seamless demo with smooth technical \
      transitions. I also learned some tips on how to recover from a failed demo, to summarize at different intervals to highlight \
      key features, to request feedback from the audience, and more.",

      // eslint-disable-next-line
      cardSubtitle: "Now that I had experience giving a demo presentation using a pre-built demo, I was allowed to create \
      my own custom demo to provide a tailored solution to my mock customer. The custom demo that I created was done in a bit of \
      a hurry, so it was pretty simple. The main objective was to send SMS messages to a customer's phone after they place an order \
      on the Owlibaba website with order status updates. To achieve this, I used an eCommerce website template that allowed me to \
      add some source code. I added a simple webhook that sent an HTTPS request to a flask server that I ran locally and exposed to \
      the internet using ngrok. Although I didn't get a chance to build a robust custom demo, I at least got the opportunity to \
      practice what I learned from giving the WISE Demo using the Owl Platform.",

      // eslint-disable-next-line
      cardSubtitle: "The WISE Showcase was a compendium of what my experience as a Solutions Engineer intern had been thus far \
      and the untold details of what it was like for me to accomplish everything that I had done. My particular showcase was focused \
      on my growth, with a focus on my difficulty with the sales side of Solutions Engineering. For this showcase, I prepared a \
      presentation that had a collage, multiple GIFs, and even a video detailing the difference in my ability between the start \
      and current dates. I had no video editing experience whatsoever, but I was adamant in creating a varied presentation in hopes \
      of adding the 'wow' aspect of demo presentations. After a few long nights, I was able to accomplish what I set out to do and \
      successfully completed my video and presented my WISE Showcase to a large segment of the Solutions Engineering team!",

      cardSubtitle: "After completing the other steps of the 4D Sales Process, it was now time to secure what we call the \
      'technical win'. Finding a solution and releasing it to the customer is not suffient to ensure that we provide a solution \
      that will satisfy our customer's needs. Instead, we must follow up with the customer after allowing them time to discover and \
      test the proposed solution. This call resembled the Mock Discovery Call in that it was a conversation with the customer that \
      required that I navigate the conversation while actively listening to the customer's concerns. This call was particularly tricky \
      because it required that I problem solve on my toes as the customer's concerns are now specific to Twilio products and services, \
      which I should be familiar with and able to resolve much more reliably. After a semi-successful rehearsal, I secured the Technical \
      Win with a new set of concerns and some tactful problem solving.",

      cardSubtitle: "A late start of my internship and an expedited schedule allowed me the luxury of an additional 3 weeks \
      after completing the Capstone Project, I will now be able to participate in many more call shadows, where I'll get the opportunity \
      to see what real-world calls are like. I'll also get to interview Twilions to learn more about their roles and the company as a whole. \
      I will also learn about more Twilio products, such as Video, and any other topics that pique my interest. I will also build and present \
      an app to earn my Red Track Jacket. If time permits, I will also play around with the available Quick Deploy projets to inspire a new \
      creation of my own, in which I hope to use Twilio's APIs to build a new creative project of my own.",
